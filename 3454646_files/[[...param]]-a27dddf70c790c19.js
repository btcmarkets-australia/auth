The new week promised a robust schedule of data between CPI, Fed rates, retail sales, and the latest updates from central banks around the world.\\n\\nShort-term traders prepared for opportunities amidst probable price swings and increased volatility. From a risk management standpoint, investors braced for discrepancies between what was ultimately priced in versus what would actually transpire. As the week progressed, the variety of high-impact market drivers indeed delivered volatility and riveting price-action as promised.\\n\\nAs in previous weeks, rising Covid cases in China continued to dampen trade sentiment, however, pandemic rules were unexpectedly relaxed at the end of last week. The Chinese government uncharacteristically pivoted to a more tempered stance on Covid Zero policy which provided relief to financial markets.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November was due. Leading into the release, markets had priced in core CPI at 0.3%, however, results surprised investors when a lower-than-expected reading of 0.1% was handed down. In the US pre-market session, equities pumped and ripped to the upside showing significant strength in price-action and a corresponding spike in implied volatility. At the open of trade, the last of the shorts were squeezed out before demand faded and sellers stepped back in.\\n\\nDespite the lower-than-expected inflation data, it wasn’t quite ‘mission accomplished’ just yet. While several deflationary indications had begun to emerge, inflation was clearly not completely under control.\\n\\nIn the latest US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell showed up in hawkish stance. The Fed downshifted to a 0.5% hike, raising the target range for the federal funds rate to 4.25%-4.5%. Powell stated that “historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. I wouldn’t see us considering rate cuts until the committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustained way.” Following his official comments, Powell added, “restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.”","_key":"d8862b94bdf4"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"abfa8704be4e"},{"style":"h3","_key":"f75f030ade71","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"State of crypto","_key":"adf4ee936774"}],"_type":"block"},{"children":[{"text":"The digital asset majors delivered exciting price action throughout the week.

Bankman-Fried raised more than $1.8 billion from investors, including U.S. investors, who bought an equity stake in FTX believing that FTX had appropriate controls and risk management measures. But from the start, Bankman-Fried improperly diverted customer assets to his privately held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, and then used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.”\\n\\nThe complaint continued, stating that “Bankman-Fried hid all of this from FTX’s equity investors, including U.S. investors, from whom he sought to raise billions of dollars in additional funds. He repeatedly cast FTX as an innovative and conservative trailblazer in the crypto markets. In truth, Bankman-Fried had exempted Alameda from the risk mitigation measures and had provided Alameda with significant special treatment on the FTX platform, including a virtually unlimited “line of credit” funded by the platform’s customers.”\\n\\nSEC Chair, Gary Gensler emphasised that “compliance protects both those who invest on and those who invest in crypto platforms with time-tested safeguards, such as properly protecting customer funds and separating conflicting lines of business. It also shines a light into trading platform conduct for both investors through disclosure and regulators through examination authority.”\\n\\nAt BTC Markets, we encourage responsible regulation which supports innovation. In Australia, we will continue to work with regulators in drafting legislation for investor protections for the digital asset class, whilst encouraging the growth and innovation of blockchain technology.

The next steps in the Government’s ongoing ‘token mapping’ work will include the release of a consultation paper in early 2023 to inform what digital assets should be regulated by financial services laws, and the development of appropriate custody and licensing settings to safeguard consumers. Following the release of token mapping, the Government will consult on a custody and licensing framework next year before introducing legislation.”\\n\\nSteve Vallas, Managing Director at Blockchain APAC, provided excellent commentary on the matter, affirming that “regulators must work more closely to ensure that the licensing and regulation of the sector balances the need for consumer protection with an environment in which innovation can be supported. The announcement reflects the Albanese Government decision to take a holistic approach in the development of a fit for purpose regulatory regime. Those calling for urgent regulation are better served agitating for an acceleration in the consultation between industry, regulators and interested stakeholders.”","_key":"549fc443d1c2","_type":"span"}],"_type":"block"},{"style":"h3","_key":"98851da2852f","markDefs":[],"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"BTC Markets Updates","_key":"1699cd2860d4","_type":"span"}],"_type":"block"},{"markDefs":[{"_type":"link","href":"https://www.scamwatch.gov.au","_key":"e098eba34276"},{"_type":"link","href":"https://www.btcmarkets.net/protect-yourself-online","_key":"390e9611321e"}],"children":[{"marks":["strong"],"text":"Happy holidays from our team!","_key":"b68cae1c12e5","_type":"span"},{"_key":"06a8d1a4eda8","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"\\n\\nAs the holiday season approaches and 2022 comes to a close, we wanted to extend our appreciation to all of our clients for your trust and support.

Throughout 2020 and nearly all of 2021, the RBA provided ongoing indication that interest rates would remain low until 2024. Acting on this message, nearly 300,000 Australians took out loans and mortgages upwards of six times their income. In his apology, Lowe stated, “I’m sorry that that happened. I’m certainly sorry if people listened to what we’d said and then acted on that.”\\n\\nIn the United States, Federal Chair Jerome Powell addressed the U.S. economic outlook, inflation, and the labour market at The Brookings Institute Hutchins Centre in Washington, DC. Fed Chair Powell commented, “today I am going to offer a progress report on the FOMC’s efforts to restore price stability to the U.S. economy for the benefit of the American people. That report must begin by acknowledging the reality that inflation remains far too high. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation is imposing significant hardship, straining budgets, and shrinking what pay checks will buy. This is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Price stability is the responsibility of the federal reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.” Powell continued, “Given our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level.”\\n\\nPowell implied that the Federal Reserve would slow the pace of interest-rate increases in December’s meeting, however, he emphasized that borrowing costs will need to remain restrictive in order to beat inflation. The market responded positively to Powell’s remarks, likely due to his comments being perceived as less hawkish than originally priced-in.\\n\\n","_key":"2b40be52f302","_type":"span"},{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"State of crypto.\\n","_key":"9d0f41402876"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Bitcoin continued to trade in a range between US$16-17.5k and Ether between US$1-1.3k.

Knowing how to store Ethereum safely yourself is arguably the most important factor in ensuring your investment is protected.","_key":"80353dbb1190","_type":"span"}]}],"publishedAt":"2021-11-29T01:22:00.000Z","excerpt":"When you’re investing in Ethereum — or any cryptocurrency for that matter — it’s critical to get educated about the best ways to store your investment and its security.

Another method for 2FA is to use a fingerprint (depending on whether or not your smartphone or computer has a biometric security setup).","_key":"63e83df9366a"}],"_type":"block"},{"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"6baa7ded9b6e","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"2FA is a great way to protect your account, as it requires physical access to your smartphone so, in the unlikely event that someone gained access to your password, they still would not be able to gain access to your account.","_key":"bd4676547cdc"}]},{"_key":"01340e7ee454","markDefs":[],"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"Backup your public and private keys to an external hard drive","_key":"5c147ad48762","_type":"span"}],"_type":"block","style":"h2"},{"style":"normal","_key":"17292ae03b59","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"There are two types of keys that every cryptocurrency holder can generate: public keys and private keys.
